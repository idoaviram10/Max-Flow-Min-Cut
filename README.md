# Max-Flow-Min-Cut

This project made in C++ and it's purpose is to use Ford-Fulkerson Alg. to implement the idea of Max flow-Min cut.


// - First, you must enter an integer (n) that represents the number of vertices in the graph.
// - Then, an integer (m) that represents the number of edges in the graph.
// - After that, two numbers must be inserted (each in a separate line), 
//   the first number represents the starting vertex of the algorithm and the second number represents the ending vertex.
// - Finally, m triples (the number of edges inserted earlier) must be taken in, each triple in a separate line, 
//   where each triple is built like this:
//   First number - origin vertex of the edge, second number - end vertex of the edge and third number - the capacity of the edge.
